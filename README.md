# Murder-mistery

"Catch the killer" is a game, where the player can try and guess who is the killer. In the beginning it should randomly choose the identity of the victim, killer and other suspects. Killer is the only one, who has the fake alibi, evidence against him, murder motive and was acting suspicious during the interrogation, while other suspects have only 2 of those things. The player can ask the investigator to reveal something about the suspect, but has limited amount of hints. When the limit is reached or the player is ready to guess, he can type the possible killer's name and check, whether he was right.
